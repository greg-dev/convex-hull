# Visualisation of algorithm for finding the convex hull of circles

Just a pointless HTML 5 canvas experiment. It was a second JavaScript project in my life, 
created for my studies (Computational Geometry course) in 2008. 
The task was to create an algorithm for finding the convex hull 
of randomly generated circles set and save results as a PostScript file. 
I saw it as an opportunity to play a little with the new <canvas> HTML element 
so I've coded it as an animated visualisation with a simple UI 
allowing to easily change number of circles, radius and control the animation.
