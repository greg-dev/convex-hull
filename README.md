## Visualization of algorithm for finding the convex hull of circles

Just a pointless HTML5 canvas experiment. It was a second JavaScript project in my life, 
created for my studies (Computational Geometry course) in 2008.
The task was to propose and implement an algorithm for finding the convex hull 
of randomly generated circles set and output results as a PostScript file. 
I saw it as an opportunity to play a little with the new &lt;canvas&gt; HTML element 
so I've added an animated live preview with a simple UI  
allowing to easily change number of circles, radius and control the animation.
